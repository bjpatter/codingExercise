If I could change one thing about Java, it would be how the code has to be written. Java uses alot of words, simulating writing a normal sentence, in order to function. This can be useful when you're someone who's unfamiliar with the language or coding altogether. By being able to type out whole words, you're able to easily comprehend exactly what's going on in a program. However, by doing this, the code can also come out very bulky looking and overtime become more of a task to scan through. If there was a way to condense the amount of words that are needed to create classes and methods, I believe Java would be an even better language to code in than it is now.
